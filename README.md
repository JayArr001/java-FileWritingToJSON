# java-FileWritingToJSON
The program simulates an online coding academy. It populates <i>n</i> random students (instantiated as Student objects) and assigns them courses, plus generates randomly selected demographics.
This information is stored in a data structure held in each Student object, which contains data about said demographics; it also includes other details about each student such as initial enrollment date and last activity.</br>
</br>
All data is output to a JSON file, "studentData.json", which is placed in the current directory where the program is executed in.
The JSON file is correctly formatted and ready to be converted immediately to JavaScript objects. This can be verified using a website such as <a href="https://jsonlint.com/"><u>jsonlint.com</u></a>.</br>
</br>
